### Future Improvements   
* Add API error handling, 
* Fully responsive UI.
* I would make improvements to UX show no search results, enable keys to select search results etc.  
* I could use React Context for my Search Bar state for a bigger app however for the scope 
of this project I utilised custom hooks for simplicity. 
* If time allowed, I would have liked to get more test coverage and write project in Typescript. 
As of now using Typescript would slow me down as I don't use it daily.
