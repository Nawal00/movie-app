# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### Improvements   
* I would add error handling and improve on UI styling/responsiveness and UX. 
* I could use React Context for my Search Bar state for a bigger app however for the scope of this project 
I used cusom hooks. 
* If time allowed, I would have liked to get more test coverage and 
write project in Typescript. As of now using Typescript would slow me down as I don't use it daily.
